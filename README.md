| Frontend       | React.js                  |
| AI Processing  | OpenCV, MediaPipe FaceMesh|
| Backend        | Flask (Python)            |
| Database       | SQL                       |

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Candidate logs in** through the React interface.
2. **AI monitoring** begins using webcam feed via FaceMesh.
3. **Real-time tracking** of eyes, face orientation, and presence.
4. **Suspicion level** is calculated and updated dynamically.
5. **PDF report** is generated and saved at the end of the session.
